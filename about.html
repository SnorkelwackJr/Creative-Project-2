    <h3><strong>What is the Cold Drink Hub?</strong></h3>
    <p>The Cold Drink Hub is a reference guide to various major breweries around
      the United States. It is a quick hub of information such as names, locations,
      contact numbers, and production types. It's intended audience is beer
      enthusiasts who like knowing their stuff! The goal of this project is to
      keep an up-to-date, curated, and publically available database of
      breweries for the betterment of the beer community and joy of web
      developers like myself.</p>
    <p>Beer is one of the oldest and most widely consumed alcoholic
      drinks in the world, and the third most popular drink overall after water
      and tea. Beer is brewed from cereal grainsâ€”most commonly from malted
      barley, though wheat, maize (corn), and rice are also used. During the
      brewing process, fermentation of the starch sugars in the wort produces
      ethanol and carbonation in the resulting beer. Most modern beer is
      brewed with hops, which add bitterness and other flavours and act as a
      natural preservative and stabilizing agent. Other flavouring agents such
      as gruit, herbs, or fruits may be included or used instead of hops. In
      commercial brewing, the natural carbonation effect is often removed during
      processing and replaced with forced carbonation. Fun fact: Some of
      humanity's earliest known writings refer to the production and
      distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws regulating beer
      and beer parlours, and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
      Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
      remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.
      Beer forms part of the culture of many nations and is associated with
      social traditions such as beer festivals, as well as a rich pub culture
      involving activities like pub crawling and pub games.</p>
